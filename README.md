# monkeyJ
Monkey J is a demo project of using monkey runner to test apps released under the MIT license (#see [LICENSE](./LICENSE)).  
In my demo script I use the module `config` to config my devices and some actions, which I decide not to be versioned. You should implement your own config or something.  
Refer MonkeyRunner's [API doc](https://developer.android.com/studio/test/monkeyrunner/index.html#APIClasses) for more information.
